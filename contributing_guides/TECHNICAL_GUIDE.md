## Getting Started

### Forking and Cloning the Repository

1. **Fork the Repository**: Navigate to the GitHub repository for the project you want to contribute to and click the **"Fork"** button in the upper right corner. This will create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tunisian-Open-Source-Initiative/The-Tunisian-Open-Source-Initiative.git
   ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd The-Tunisian-Open-Source-Initiative
   ```

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

- **Dependencies**: Follow the `README.md` file to set up any necessary dependencies. Each project may have different requirements, so refer to the project's setup guide.

- **Install Tools**: Make sure you have Git and any other relevant tools installed (e.g., Node.js, Python, Docker, etc., depending on the project).

### Syncing with the Upstream Repository

1. **Add the Upstream Repository**:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Tunisian-Open-Source-Initiative/The-Tunisian-Open-Source-Initiative.git
   ```

2. **Sync Your Fork**: Before starting work on any new feature or bug fix, make sure your fork is up to date:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

## Contribution Workflow

### Finding Issues

- **Browse Issues**: Visit the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/Tunisian-Open-Source-Initiative/The-Tunisian-Open-Source-Initiative/issues) to see the list of open issues. Look for labels like `good first issue`, `bug`, or `enhancement`.
- **Discuss**: If you're interested in working on an issue, comment on it to let the community know and to ask any clarifying questions.

### Working on Issues

1. **Create a Branch**: Always create a new branch for each feature or bug fix to keep your work organized and easy to manage:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes**: Work on your feature or bug fix. Ensure that your code adheres to the [Coding Guidelines](#coding-guidelines).

3. **Commit Your Changes**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: your-feature-name"
   ```

4. **Push to Your Fork**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Creating Pull Requests

1. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click on the **"Compare & pull request"** button.

2. **Write a Clear PR Description**:
   - Describe what changes you made.
   - Reference the issue number (e.g., `Closes #123`).
   - Explain why the changes are needed and any context necessary for reviewers.

3. **Submit the PR**: Once your pull request is ready, submit it. The maintainers will review your code and provide feedback if necessary.

## Coding Guidelines

### Code Style

Maintaining consistent code style helps keep the project readable and maintainable:

- **Languages**: Follow the standard style guides for each programming language:
  - **Python**: [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
  - **JavaScript**: [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
  - **HTML/CSS**: [HTML5 Boilerplate Code Style](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/main/doc/code-guide.md)
  
- **Indentation**: Use consistent indentation (spaces or tabs) as indicated in the project.

- **Naming Conventions**: Use meaningful variable, function, and file names.

### Commit Messages

- **Write Clear Messages**: Use descriptive commit messages that explain the "what" and "why" of the changes.
- **Follow Conventional Commits**: Use a consistent format, e.g., `fix: correct spelling error in header` or `feat: add new authentication service`.

### Documentation

- **Code Comments**: Add comments to explain complex logic.
- **README Updates**: If your changes affect how the project is used, update the `README.md` or other documentation files.

---

## Testing

- **Write Tests**: Ensure that you add or update tests for any new features or bug fixes. Use the testing framework specified by the project (e.g., Jest, PyTest).
- **Run Tests Locally**: Always run the test suite locally before pushing changes:

  ```bash
  # Example for running Python tests
  pytest tests/
  ```

- **Pass All Tests**: Make sure all tests pass to avoid breaking the project for others.

---

## Code Review Process

- **Review Time**: Once you submit a PR, reviewers will check your code. The review process may take some time, depending on the availability of maintainers.
- **Respond to Feedback**: Be prepared to make changes based on the feedback provided. Discussions during code review help improve code quality and share knowledge.
- **Be Respectful**: Always be respectful in code reviewsâ€”focus on the code, not the person.

---

## Community Support

- **Discord**: Join our [Discord community](hhttps://discord.gg/cTn5EPjE) to ask questions and discuss your ideas.
- **GitHub Discussions**: Participate in ongoing discussions or start a new thread if you have a question or idea.
